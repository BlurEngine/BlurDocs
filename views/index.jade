        h2 What is Blur?
      p.
        #[b Blur] is a Minecraft Game Engine designed with abstraction in mind. 
        A wide range of modules accessible through Blur allow you to make your ideas a reality.
        The name Blur comes from the idea of abstraction, everything is broken into modules, alone they make little to no sense.
        During your time here you will experience the eye-pleasing documentation of Blur breaking everything down from #[em What a Filter is] to #[em How to create complex Filters].

      p.
        Blur's abstraction makes it inexpensive for you to make your ideas a reality without having 
        to hire expensive developers to get the job done.
